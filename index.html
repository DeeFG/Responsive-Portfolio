<p><i>"When looking for a career, find something you love to do, then find a way to make a lot of money doing it." @RandomQouteIHeardOnce </i>

<p> At this very moment I am a skilled blood banker at a level 1 trauma center. My job makes me proud but like<a link rel="stylesheet" href="https://youtu.be/c8eYPDmpyd4"> MarieKondo </a> would say, <i> <strong> if it doesn't spark  joy, let it go.</u></strong><itlaics></i>  
<br>
<p>Okay, I'm done inspiring....</p> 
<p> Culture and travel are my passion. I found myself building a platform on social networks sharing photos and my experience as a woman of color traveling around the world. I decided to start a website/blog to have my content in one place. I didn't care for the themed layouts online, so I decided to build my own. </p>
<p>  This is where the Web Dev career enters !  </p>
<p> I realized the amount of coding skills I had learned back in high school and in my free time were not enough to get my site where I wanted it. I needed to learn more programming languages.</p> 

<p> I want to spark joy and be successful on my own terms. This is why I chose to go from a blood banker who saves  lives to a web developer who saves code.</p>
